# Machine Learning Portfolio

Hello! My name is Karol and I want to share my ever growing Machine Learning portfolio. Inside this repository you will find list of my past projects consisting of self-developed applications, final college works and various other from online courses.

<br>

## [Conversational GPT-2 Fine Tuning with Langchain](https://github.com/kora11e/GPT-2-fine-tuning)
- Overview: The goal was to achieve working conversational model, which was developed in simplistic python code and langchain framework. The model was fully tuned using news articles [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/canicule/articles-csv)
- Technologies: Python, Huggingface, Langchain, Transformers

## [Animal image detection implementation with Recursive CNN](https://github.com/kora11e/Fish-image-detection-implementation-with-RCNN)
- Overview: The project covers techniques of processing image data with packages Coco, albumentaitons, opencv and torchvision. Its goal is to produce stable image pipeline and perform Faster RCNN model classification and tune it to operate on new data to perform convolution operation on set of images and classfiy area of them to find different types of fishes. The project was created to practice object-oriented image data processing and apply dynamic drawing boxes.
- Technologies: Python, cv2, pytorch
  
## [Vesuvian Scrolls Image Segmentation](https://github.com/kora11e/vesuvius-scrolls-segmentation)
- Overview: The project was developed during Vesuvius Surface Detection Challenge. The goal was to construct accurate Deep Learning model for segmentation of CT Scans for the facilitation of detecting and deciphering Pompeii Scrolls. - [Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vesuvius-challenge-surface-detection/overview)
- Technologies: Python, Keras, napari, matplotlib
  
## [Hierarchical Reconstruction Library](https://github.com/kora11e/HCR-NN-Library)
- Overview: A professional, modular Python library for Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction with Neural Networks (HCR-NN). Developed for Python and R.
- Technologies: Python, R, C++, CUDA, PyTorch
  
## [CUDA Kernels (part of HCR Library)](https://github.com/kora11e/HCR-NN-Library/tree/main/C_kernels)
- Overview: A subset of Hierarchical COrrelation Reconstruction project. Custom CUDA kernels were developed. Firstly in high level numba interface for testing and matrix calculations. Then the final version was deployed using low level C++ implementation as .ptx library.
- Technologies: CUDA, Numba
  
## [DeepQ Snake Agent](https://github.com/kora11e/PyTorch-Agent-Snake-Game)
- Overview: This project is a demonstration of the potential of artificial intelligence in playing and mastering video games. It leverages the power of PyTorch for the neural network and reinforcement learning components, combined with the Pygame library for game implementation and visualization. The result is an AI agent capable of playing the classic Snake game autonomously, learning and improving its performance through experience.
- Technologies: Python, PyGames, PyTorch

## [Akkadian to English Machine Translation](https://link-url-here.org)
- Overview: Machine Translation project developed for [Deep Past Challenge - Translate Akkadian to English](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/deep-past-initiative-machine-translation). The goal is to fine tune and/or create custom large language model capable of easiliy translating dead Akkadian language to english.
- Technologies: Python, Transformers, PyTorch
